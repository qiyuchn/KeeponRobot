# KeeponRobot

Cornell Organizational Robotics Lab

Combine_1Key_trial 
This is a modified version of program from Henny Admoni's website (HennyAdmoni.com/keeon/)
	For our project, we specifically want to control movement such as Nodding, Roll right/left, Lean forward/back, and Bop. 
	
ComKeyWriter
	This is a short program we wrote to open a COM port in C#. We used Microsoft Visual Studio. This allow us to enter direct one-key-press command over Keepon, so that we don't need to use serial monitor on Arduino IDE (Command + Enter).
